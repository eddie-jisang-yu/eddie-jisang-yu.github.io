# Eddie Jisang Yu, CPA
**JD/PhD Candidate in Accounting · Stanford University**  
Certified Public Accountant (Washington)

I study how regulation shapes financial reporting, disclosure, and market behavior.  
My research lies at the intersection of **securities law**, **information economics**, and **financial accounting**.

## Research

My research examines how legal and regulatory frictions interact with firms’ reporting incentives, and how these frictions shape capital market outcomes.

- *Working Paper Title* — with Coauthor(s). *(Abstract coming soon.)*
- Additional projects forthcoming.

For a full list of papers, see the [Research](/research) page.
